    <p>
The Big Three was a term used to describe the three most popular running series during
their golden age in Jump's mid 2000s period - One Piece, Naruto and Bleach.

    <h3 style="color: brown;">Origin</h3>
    <p>The nickname "The Big Three" came about due to their immense worldwide popularity
       and length. With that, they were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump
        covers and always had bigger images for their main protagonists: Luffy, Naruto and
         Ichigo.

      While the three series weren't the biggest sellers in the magazine, Hunter x Hunter  
      more per volume than Bleach for example, they kept their position on the covers due 
      to their overall popularity.
      
      These three manga have each received long running anime series, Bleach has 366 
      episodes, soldNaruto (+Shippuden) has 720 episodes, and One Piece has 1000 episodes
       as of November 2021, with One Piece and Boruto, Naruto Shippuden's sequel, still airing.
        These statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels, and movies, so the full numbers
         for entire franchises are higher.
